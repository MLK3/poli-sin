THIS PROJECT IS PART OF THE [POLI-LIBRAS PROJECT](http://www.polilibras.com.br).

Poli-Libras is a Portuguese to LIBRAS translator, where LIBRAS is the Brazilian Sign Language.

The syntactic analyser parses a statement to give its syntactic structure.

By default it includes the jspell as morphologic analiser library, through the [jjspell](http://code.google.com/p/jjspell/), a Java wrapper to Jspell.

It's necessary also modelling the target language (as Portuguese) as a free context grammar in a text file.
